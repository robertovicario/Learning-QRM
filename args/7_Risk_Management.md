### Summary of Risk Management Topics

#### Links Between Quality Management System and Risk Management

Risk-based thinking is a core principle in ISO 9001:2015, allowing organizations to identify potential factors that could cause deviations in their processes and quality management systems. It encourages preventive controls to minimize negative effects and leverage opportunities. While ISO 9001:2015 does not mandate a formal risk assessment, ISO 31000 provides a comprehensive framework that organizations can reference for a more structured approach to risk management【7†source】.

#### Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

**Principles of ERM:**
- ERM is about managing risks from all sources to enhance value for stakeholders.
- It enables organizations to handle uncertainty, reducing downside outcomes and increasing upside potential.
- ERM integrates risk management into strategic decision-making and daily operations.

**Types of Risks Addressed by ERM:**
- **Compliance Risk:** Violation of laws or regulations.
- **Legal Risk:** Litigation or regulatory penalties.
- **Strategic Risk:** Threats to long-term objectives.
- **Operational Risk:** Daily operational disruptions.
- **Security Risk:** Misappropriation of assets.
- **Financial Risk:** Financial losses, such as currency fluctuations【7†source】.

#### ISO 31000: Main Features and Structure

**Overview:**
- ISO 31000 offers principles and guidelines for risk management applicable to any organization, regardless of size, activity, or location.
- It focuses on identifying, assessing, and managing risks in a logical, systematic manner.
- ISO 31000 is not for certification but provides practical support for developing effective risk management strategies【7†source】.

**Components:**
1. **Principles:** Basis for effective risk management in organizations.
2. **Structure:** Framework for integrating risk management into the organization.
3. **Process:** Steps for managing risks, including identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment【7†source】.

#### Risk Management Process (from ISO 31000)

1. **Identification:** Listing potential hazards and creating a risk inventory.
2. **Analysis:** Assessing the probability and impact of each risk.
3. **Evaluation:** Ranking risks to prioritize actions.
4. **Treatment:** Deciding on actions to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid risks.
5. **Monitoring and Review:** Continuously improving and communicating the risk management process【7†source】【7†source】.

#### Risk Management Tools

**Consequence/Probability Matrix:**
- **Description:** A matrix correlating the potential severity of harm with the likelihood of occurrence.
- **Usage:** Assigns values to each risk based on likelihood (L) and severity (S) to calculate a risk index (R = L x S).
- **Outputs:** Risk matrices and indices prioritize interventions【7†source】.

**HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study):**
- **Purpose:** Identifies hazards and operability issues by examining deviations from design intentions.
- **Procedure:**
  1. Divide the system into sections.
  2. Choose study nodes.
  3. Describe design intentions.
  4. Select process parameters.
  5. Apply guide-words.
  6. Determine causes.
  7. Evaluate consequences.
  8. Recommend actions.
  9. Record information.
  10. Repeat the process【7†source】.

**Fault Tree Analysis (FTA):**
- **Description:** A deductive reasoning technique analyzing system failures leading to a top event.
- **Steps:**
  1. Select the top event.
  2. Identify events contributing to the top event.
  3. Relate events using logical gates.
  4. Perform qualitative and quantitative analysis.
- **Outputs:** Lists of events causing specific accidents, qualitatively ranked by importance. Quantitative evaluation is possible with probabilistic data【6†source】.

**Event Tree Analysis (ETA):**
- **Description:** Evaluates potential accident outcomes following an initiating event.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify an accidental event.
  2. Identify barriers.
  3. Construct the event tree.
  4. Describe accident sequences.
  5. Determine frequencies and probabilities.
  6. Calculate probabilities for outcomes.
  7. Present results【5†source】.

These tools provide a structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks, essential for robust risk management practices in organizations.
