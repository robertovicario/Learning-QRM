# Introduction to Quality

## Definition

Quality refers to the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements. These requirements can be defined in terms of products, services, processes, or an entire organization. Quality encompasses various dimensions such as product quality, service quality, process quality, and company quality.

## Quality Perspectives

Quality can be viewed from different perspectives:

1. **Transcendent Perspective:** Quality is synonymous with superiority or excellence.
2. **Product-based Perspective:** Quality is a function of specific, measurable variables.
3. **User-based Perspective:** Quality is determined by how well the product or service meets the needs and expectations of customers.
4. **Manufacturing-based Perspective:** Quality is the desirable output of engineering and manufacturing practices, emphasizing conformance to specifications.
5. **Value-based Perspective:** Quality is the relationship between the usefulness or satisfaction of a product or service and its price.


## History

The concept of quality has evolved over time through several key phases:

1. **1920s:** Introduction of Statistical Quality Control by pioneers like Walter Shewhart.
2. **1940s-1950s:** Quality revolution in Japan with contributions from Joseph Juran and W. Edwards Deming.
