# Quality Management Systems

## Definition and Characteristics

A Quality Management System (QMS) is a formalized system documenting processes, procedures, and responsibilities for achieving quality policies and objectives. QMSs help businesses ensure that their products and services consistently meet customer requirements and that quality is consistently improved. This systematization includes clear roles and responsibilities, state-of-the-art models, employee engagement, accountability, and continuous improvement through audits.
