# Focusing on Customers

## The Role of Service in Customer Satisfaction

Service quality is pivotal in determining customer satisfaction. Service dimensions impacting customer satisfaction include delivery time, punctuality, assistance services, and pre-sale services. High-quality service can enhance customer loyalty and drive repeat business, which is crucial for long-term success.

## Determinants of Customer Satisfaction

Customer satisfaction is influenced by various factors:

- **Freedom from faults:** Ensuring the product or service is defect-free.
- **Meeting expectations:** Aligning product/service performance with customer expectations.
- **Emotional engagement:** Building a strong emotional connection with customers.
- **Quality of contact:** The effectiveness and quality of interactions with the supplier.
- **Service and personnel:** The level of service provided and the behavior of the organization's personnel.
- **Organization's image and price:** The overall image of the organization and the perceived value for money.

## Six Sigma Tools for Customer Satisfaction

1. **Voice of Customer (VOC):**
   - **What it is:** VOC is a process of capturing customers' requirements, expectations, and preferences.
   - **How it works:** Methods include indirect (warranty claims, complaints) and direct (surveys, focus groups) approaches.
   - **Addressing Six Sigma Philosophy:** VOC aligns with Six Sigma by systematically gathering customer feedback to improve processes and meet specifications.

2. **Critical to Quality (CTQ):**
   - **What it is:** CTQs are specific, measurable aspects of a product or service that are critical to meeting customer satisfaction.
   - **How it works:** CTQs are derived from VOC data and help in defining performance standards and metrics.
   - **Addressing Six Sigma Philosophy:** CTQs ensure that customer requirements are translated into measurable parameters for process improvement.

3. **Kano Model:**
   - **What it is:** A model that categorizes customer requirements into three types: Must-Be, Performance, and Delighters.
   - **How it works:** Identifies basic needs that must be met, performance needs that enhance satisfaction, and delighters that exceed expectations.
   - **Addressing Six Sigma Philosophy:** Helps prioritize customer needs and focus on areas that can lead to significant satisfaction improvements.

4. **Affinity Diagram:**
   - **What it is:** A tool for organizing VOC data into logical groups to identify patterns.
   - **How it works:** VOC data is sorted into categories to facilitate understanding and action.
   - **Addressing Six Sigma Philosophy:** Helps in visualizing and categorizing customer feedback for better analysis and decision-making.

5. **CTQ Tree:**
   - **What it is:** A tool used to break down customer requirements into specific, measurable CTQs.
   - **How it works:** Maps out customer needs and translates them into operational parameters.
   - **Addressing Six Sigma Philosophy:** Ensures that each customer requirement is linked to a measurable business parameter, aiding in precise process improvements.

## The SERVQUAL Model

1. **What it is:**
   - SERVQUAL is a model for assessing service quality by comparing customer expectations with their actual service experiences.

2. **Benefits:**
   - Provides a structured approach to identify and measure service quality gaps.
   - Helps in tracking customer perceptions over time and improving service delivery.

3. **Logic and Gap Analysis:**
   - **Gap 1:** Difference between customer expectations and management perceptions of those expectations.
   - **Gap 2:** Difference between management perceptions and service quality specifications.
   - **Gap 3:** Difference between service quality specifications and actual service delivery.
   - **Gap 4:** Difference between actual service delivery and external communications about the service.
   - **Gap 5:** Difference between customer expectations and their perceptions of the service received.

4. **Five Key Service Dimensions:**
   - **Reliability:** Consistency and dependability in service performance.
   - **Responsiveness:** Willingness and promptness in helping customers.
   - **Assurance:** Ability to convey trust and confidence.
   - **Empathy:** Providing caring and individualized attention.
   - **Tangibles:** Physical evidence of the service, such as facilities and personnel appearance.

5. **Uses of the SERVQUAL Model:**
   - Assess service quality from the customer's perspective.
   - Track changes in customer expectations and perceptions.
   - Identify and prioritize areas for improvement in service delivery.

6. **Advantages:**
   - Standardized for assessing various service dimensions.
   - Valid and reliable for different service situations.
   - Parsimonious with a straightforward analysis procedure.
